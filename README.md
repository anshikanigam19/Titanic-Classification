PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Titanic Classification Project uses the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which includes information on the passengers of the Titanic, such as age, gender, fare, and whether they survived or not. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of various machine learning algorithms to predict survival.

DATASET

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which is available on Kaggle. It consists of two CSV files:


train.csv: Training data set containing the target variable (Survived) and features.

test.csv: Test data set containing the features only.
